            <p class="text">
              Our product is a Smart Environmental Monitoring System (SEMS), which is a modular system that utilizes various sensors to monitor environmental factors like air quality, radiation levels, light intensity, and temperature, and relays this data to a user-friendly app interface in real-time. Our sensors will be housed in a cubical figure with holes in the structure for the sensors that need to be exposed to the outside environment, and the figure will be created through 3-D printing. 
              This product will be used in various healthcare applications, such as operation rooms, biotech labs, dentistry clinics, medical imaging centers, and other locations that pose similar needs in regards to such as air quality and radiation detection. In addition to the physical model that will be created, this p will also have a website that our group will be creating using front-end development tools, starting with designing and developing the user interface with React.JS. The backend portion of our project will have a large emphasis on data analysis from our sensors to offer real-time information and recommendations.

              The main objective of this project is to create a device that analyzes different characteristics of the environment surrounding it and can be used in many different applications. Customers of various needs can benefit from this product because of all of the different sensors, which detect air quality, light intensity, temperature, and radiation levels.
              The purpose of the SEMS is to build a multifaceted device that can be used effectively and efficiently for numerous uses. The project provides information about the specific area the customer wishes to use it in, and gives the customer useful analysis and recommendations based on that analysis to help them maintain a safe or optimal environment.

              Attached below is our model for SEMS. This model takes into account the dimensions of each component in 3D, and totals in a square prism of base 153” x 153”, and height 153”. To note, the 28” length is subdivided within the box into a 18” length on the large ventilation side, and a 8” length on the smaller vent and hinged side of the box. The first drawing is a blown up image of the inside components, and the second is the view from the outside of the box as the user.

              The plastic shell of SEMS is designed in a rectangular prism shell with a divider separating part of the box into a container with the non-sensor components, and the other containing a few of the sensors and proper ventilation in the faces of the prism. This decision was made to maintain the quality of the environment subjected to the sensors for accurate measurements. There is an opening between these two sides for chords to enter and attach to the sensors from the raspberry pi, however, this space will be minimized to prevent air flow from one side to the other. Additional openings on the box are minimal and attached to sensors nearly flush with the solid shape to ensure a compact design and efficiency of the sensors.
