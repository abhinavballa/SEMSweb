      <h3>Physical Design</h3>
      <p class="text">
        <!-- <img class="image image-wrap-text max-width-400" src="img/dummay-img.png"> -->
        Attached below is our model for SEMS. This model takes into account the dimensions of each component in 
        3D, and totals in a square prism of base 12” x 28”, and height 12”. To note, the 28” length is subdivided 
        within the box into a 18” length on the large ventilation side, and a 8” length on the smaller vent and hinged 
        side of the box. The first drawing is a blown up image of the inside components, and the second is the view from 
        the outside of the box as the user.
      </p>
      <h4>Rationale Behind the Design</h4>
      <p class="text">
        The plastic shell of SEMS is designed in a rectangular prism shell with a divider separating part of the box into 
        a container with the non-sensor components, and the other containing a few of the sensors and proper ventilation in 
        the faces of the prism. This decision was made to maintain the quality of the environment subjected to the sensors for 
        accurate measurements. There is an opening between these two sides for chords to enter and attach to the sensors from 
        the raspberry pi, however, this space will be minimized to prevent air flow from one side to the other. Additional openings 
        on the box are minimal and attached to sensors nearly flush with the solid shape to ensure a compact design and efficiency of the sensors. 
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        Other important foundation design choices include shelves for components to prevent cramping of the space, and a layered placement of 
        sensors to follow air flow of the box to give the sensors essential room for one another to operate correctly. The vents are placed on the 
        sensor side, with one on the top and another on the bottom to trace the air flow from hot to cold. The temperature sensor is placed on the 
        bottom, to accurately measure the temperature of the immediate air flow, while other sensors are placed in convenient locations to have accurate 
        readings and comfortable space to calibrate the sensors.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        For the functionality of calibration and maintenance, this design integrates the use of two plastic hinges attached to the circuit side of the 
        box that allow the entire lid to be opened perpendicularly to the top face. This allows the designer and user to adjust any issues with the sensors, 
        and recalibrate if necessary. The sensors placed on the top will not be obstructed when lifting the lid because their wires will be clipped to the 
        top of the box and run through small holes in between the divider and lid.
      </p>
      <h3>Electrical Design</h3>
      <h4>Battery Supply</h4>
      <p class="text">
        We decided to use a lithium-ion battery to supply power to our product in order to significantly decrease the chances 
        of the sensors unexpectedly pulling excessive voltage and damaging our Raspberry Pi. The power requirements of our sensors 
        could potentially lead to the Raspberry Pi overheating, resulting in substantial expenses. To mitigate this issue, we will 
        be using various jumper wires in order to create a wired system between our breadboard and battery. The battery pack also 
        offers the advantage of recharging when depleted, making it a cost-effective solution for operating the SEMS.
      </p>
      <h4>Raspberry Pi 4 Model B</h4>
      <p class="text">
        The Raspberry Pi contains ports for the input and output, which facilitates the transmission of signals for the SEMS. 
        Furthermore, the Raspberry Pi 4 features 3.3V and 5V pins. The 3.3V pins are dedicated to input and output signals, which we 
        have 40 of, allowing us to work with voltages ranging from 0 to 3.3V. This range is particularly useful for distinguishing 
        between various sensors, although we might require a higher voltage to accommodate the number of sensors. The 5V pin serves as 
        a power source, providing the necessary 5V power to energize the sensors. To oversee these ports, a Raspberry Pi control module 
        will be employed, which is equipped with an ESP8266 microcontroller that will allow us to switch modules comfortably.
      </p>
      <h4>Circuit Design</h4>
      <p class="text">
        The circuit design of this project will consist of our sensors being connected to a Raspberry Pi and a breadboard. There will be 
        an ON button for our system and we do not plan to have the SEMS plugged in to the wall, and have opted to make the system wireless 
        as we have bluetooth functionality and also chose a lithium ion battery that has rechargeable capabilities. Furthermore, each of our
        sensors will be connected to different I/O pins of the Raspberry Pi as we need to have different voltage values in order to identify 
        which sensor is inputting information, and this will allow us to determine what data is being outputted to our website. Additionally, 
        each of our sensors are connected to a transistor that will switch on when it determines the correct voltage output for each of our 
        individual sensors.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        From there, the output from the transistor will be sent to a pin on the Raspberry Pi that we can collect and use to determine which data 
        is being outputted to the website. This occurs because we want to guarantee that there is only a max of two inputs that are occurring 
        simultaneously in real-time detection and it will switch as each input actively changes. The sensors will also be grounded to the negative 
        terminal of the Raspberry Pi, and we will have the ON button act as the power button which turns off our system. Our battery will also be 
        connected and grounded to the Raspberry Pi and will get recharged as it is powered up when not in use.
