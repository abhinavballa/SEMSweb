      <h3>Electrical Design</h3>
      <h4>Battery Supply</h4>
      <p class="text">
        We decided to use a lithium-ion battery to supply power to our product in order to significantly decrease the chances 
        of the sensors unexpectedly pulling excessive voltage and damaging our Raspberry Pi. The power requirements of our sensors 
        could potentially lead to the Raspberry Pi overheating, resulting in substantial expenses. To mitigate this issue, we will 
        be using various jumper wires in order to create a wired system between our breadboard and battery. The battery pack also 
        offers the advantage of recharging when depleted, making it a cost-effective solution for operating the SEMS.
      </p>
      <h4>Raspberry Pi 4 Model B</h4>
      <p class="text">
        The Raspberry Pi contains ports for the input and output, which facilitates the transmission of signals for the SEMS. 
        Furthermore, the Raspberry Pi 4 features 3.3V and 5V pins. The 3.3V pins are dedicated to input and output signals, which we 
        have 40 of, allowing us to work with voltages ranging from 0 to 3.3V. This range is particularly useful for distinguishing 
        between various sensors, although we might require a higher voltage to accommodate the number of sensors. The 5V pin serves as 
        a power source, providing the necessary 5V power to energize the sensors. To oversee these ports, a Raspberry Pi control module 
        will be employed, which is equipped with an ESP8266 microcontroller that will allow us to switch modules comfortably.
      </p>
      <h4>Circuit Design</h4>
      <p class="text">
        The circuit design of this project will consist of our sensors being connected to a Raspberry Pi and a breadboard. There will be 
        an ON button for our system and we do not plan to have the SEMS plugged in to the wall, and have opted to make the system wireless 
        as we have bluetooth functionality and also chose a lithium ion battery that has rechargeable capabilities. Furthermore, each of our
        sensors will be connected to different I/O pins of the Raspberry Pi as we need to have different voltage values in order to identify 
        which sensor is inputting information, and this will allow us to determine what data is being outputted to our website. Additionally, 
        each of our sensors are connected to a transistor that will switch on when it determines the correct voltage output for each of our 
        individual sensors.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        From there, the output from the transistor will be sent to a pin on the Raspberry Pi that we can collect and use to determine which data 
        is being outputted to the website. This occurs because we want to guarantee that there is only a max of two inputs that are occurring 
        simultaneously in real-time detection and it will switch as each input actively changes. The sensors will also be grounded to the negative 
        terminal of the Raspberry Pi, and we will have the ON button act as the power button which turns off our system. Our battery will also be 
        connected and grounded to the Raspberry Pi and will get recharged as it is powered up when not in use.
